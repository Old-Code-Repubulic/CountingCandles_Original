# CountingCandles_Original
Created this project based on a recent technical interview I had. I unfortunately did not finish in time, so I re-created it based on what I remembered. The purpose is to 
get the max value in an array, pull out all numbers that match the max value, and the get the sum. In the case I created, the largest number is 7 and it appears 3 times, so the sum
is 21.
