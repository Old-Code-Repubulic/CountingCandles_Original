##Counting Candles

Simply, this is a project I created based off of a C# problem I was giving during an interview. The point
was to take values from an array, find the largest(max) integer, find how many times that integer shows, then
get the sum of all of the largest integer. The integers will be "candles". 

I unfortunately ran out of time during the interview, before I chose which way I wanted to iterate through the array.
This time I create an int List<int>, iterated through the candles array, and each time the index value matched
the largest (max) integer, it was added to the List<int>. Then at the end, I simply summed the values in the List
and wrote them to the console line!
